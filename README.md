It's self descriptive. Made Jan. 2022

- Came up with this program while making the random file picker, yesterday.
- The overall goal is to make an O.S in python that runs over windows, eventually. The idea is completely useless, but still fun and intriguing.
- .
- How to use: open file. typing help, lists commands
- Command list:
- cd: allows changing of directories.
- cd quick commands (input after typing cd, then enter): documents, music, desktop, downloads, pictures.
- open: open will ask whether you are opening a file or folder ( this was to avoid the program unintentionally making a file into the new directory path.)
- file ( input after open): will open a file using your default application for said file.
- folder (input after open): will make the folder name you type in, into your new directory.
- random: opens a random file inside the current folder
- listdir: lists all items inside folder
- time: tells the time.
- calc: opens built-in calculator. command to exit calculator is quit or exit
- web: will ask you which webpage to open, ex. type www.google.com to open google in your web browser, not sure if it always opens default browser, as webbrowser function occasionally opened Internet Explorer while I was making the Random File Opener program.
- .
- the program relies upon making a txt file called current_dir.txt, which will be ovewritten everytime the directory changes. This was to avoid problems with the directory staying as a static C://users

- V.0.1 Notes: working as intended. However, calculator function has not been added yet. Made 05:10 2022-01-30 in about 5 hours.
- V.0.2 Change Notes: Added Simple calculator function, however as of yet it can only use whole numbers, access via calc command, and remember to use spaces between numbers and equation symbols, like: 1 + 1. Moved all functions into classes. Added Web Page function, that will open a web page in your browser, access function via web command. Going to add a unit conversion class in V.0.3.

- If anyone actually tries to use this program, why?
