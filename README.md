# File_and_folder_crawler
It's self descriptive. Made Jan. 2022

- Came up with this program while making the random file picker, yesterday.
- The overall goal is to make an O.S in python that runs over windows, eventually. The idea is completely useless, but still fun and intriguing.
- .
- How to use: open file. typing help, lists commands
- Command list:
- cd: allows changing of directories. V.0.3 Notes: 2 word command usable, ex. cd C:/users/example/music
- cd quick commands (input after typing cd, ex. cd music): documents, music, desktop, downloads, pictures.
- open: open will ask whether you are opening a file or folder ( this was to avoid the program unintentionally making a file into the new directory path.)
- file ( input after open. ex. open file): will open a file using your default application for said file. cannot use a 3 word command as of V.0.3
- folder (input after open. ex. open folder Example.): will make the folder name you type in, into your new directory.
- random: opens a random file inside the current folder
- listdir: lists all items inside folder
- time: tells the time.
- calc: opens built-in calculator. command to exit calculator is quit or exit
- web: will ask you which webpage to open, ex. type www.google.com to open google in your web browser, not sure if it always opens default browser, as webbrowser function occasionally opened Internet Explorer while I was making the Random File Opener program.
- converter: opens built in unit converter.
- random loop: same as random, but has y/n prompt loop to open another random file.
- coin: opens built-in coin-flip. has y/n prompt, type n to stop.
- floor: opens built-in floor tile cost estimator
- .
- the program relies upon making a txt file called current_dir.txt, which will be ovewritten everytime the directory changes. This was to avoid problems with the directory staying as a static C://users

- V.0.1 Notes: working as intended. However, calculator function has not been added yet. Made 05:10 2022-01-30 in about 5 hours.
- V.0.2 Change Notes: Added Simple calculator function, however as of yet it can only use whole numbers, access via calc command, and remember to use spaces between numbers and equation symbols, like: 1 + 1. Moved all functions into classes. Added Web Page function, that will open a web page in your browser, access function via web command. Going to add a unit conversion class in V.0.3. Made 2022-01-31 ~4:00
- V.0.2.1 Change Notes: changed integars to floats, to allow calculator to use decimals
- V.0.3 Change Notes: moved open folder function, to the main function. Changed how the input command works to allow for 3 words instead of only one. Added unit converter, accessed via convert command, forgot to update help command, to display converter as a commmand. Made 2022-01-31 09:10
- V.0.4 Change Notes: Now 3 word open file command is allowed. Added temperature converter, random loop function, coin flip, and floor tile cost calculator. Made 2022-01-31 12:00... Note: V.0.4 has error when entering files or folders that contain spaces, will be fixed in next version. coin_flip had error where it only repeats one answer, this was due to writing tails for both outputs on accident. be fixed in next version.
- V.0.4.2 Update Notes: Whole Program rewritten to make multiple word commands work easier, and incorporate dictionary for commands. Incorperating different languages, because I figure it might be useful to know how to do. Whole program will have English, Finnish, and Swedish language options, that can be switched, using a commmand. It will write to a seperate language text file, that contains default language. - mostly done with dictionaries, only have swedish left, but I'll probably leave that to v.0.5, hope I never have to rewrite them. tested methods to do filetype exclusions using a user input.

- V.0.4.2 Note: Switched to VScode. Was using IDLE before, never knew what I was missing. I'm halfway there, whooah.
- .
- V.0.5 Update Plans: Add scissors paper rock game. Coming out 2022-02-02, probably. combine text files into one. 
- Note on text advanture. It is taking a lot longer than expected, figuring out what text adventures are and how they work as i go. v.0.1 will probably be out 02.02.2022 
- V.0.6 Update Plans: weather tracking. Probably soon, it is a lot easier than expected. But it will require an api key.
- V.0.7 Update Plans: Integrate program that tracks public transport by district and area, inside Uusimaa though.
